I am Tianyi Wang, a senior Ph.D. candidate in the College of Control Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University. Advised by [Prof. Cong Wang](https://cwang-zju.github.io/) from the [NeSC Group](http://nesc.zju.edu.cn/), I actively collaborate with [Prof. Jiming Chen](https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/jmchen), [Prof. Peng Cheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cp), [Prof. Yuanchao Shu](https://yshu.org/). My current research focuses on object detection models and developing robust adversarial attack/defense mechanisms for deep learning systems. Prior to this, I conducted investigations into binary communication protocol fuzzing.
